# runDM

`runDM` is a tool for calculating the low energy couplings of Dark Matter (DM) to light quarks in Simplified Models with vector mediators. By specifying the mass of the mediator and the couplings of the mediator to SM fields at high energy, the code outputs the low energy couplings to up, down and strange quarks, taking into account the mixing of all dimension-6 operators.

At present, the code is written in two languages: *Mathematica* and *Python*. If you are interested in an implementation in another language, please get in touch and we'll do what we can to add it.

Please contact Bradley Kavanagh (bradkav@gmail.com) for any questions, problems, bugs and suggestions.
